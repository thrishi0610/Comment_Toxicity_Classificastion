**TOXIC COMMENT CLASSIFIER**

This project is a deep learning-based application for classifying user-generated comments as toxic or non-toxic. It leverages a simple neural network architecture, built using TensorFlow, and is deployed with an interactive Gradio interface. The entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to deployment, is implemented in Google Colab.

**OVERVIEW**

The goal of this project is to identify toxic behavior in online comments. Using the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification dataset, the model is trained to detect whether a comment contains toxicity, and then deployed with a minimal UI for real-time testing.

**FEATURES**

1) Text preprocessing and tokenization

2) Neural network model for binary classification

3) TensorFlow implementation with GPU acceleration (Colab)

4) Gradio interface for live testing

5) Ready-to-use in Google Colab

**DATASET**

The project uses the publicly available Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification dataset, which contains thousands of comments labeled for various types of toxicity such as:

toxic

severe_toxic

obscene

threat

insult

identity_hate
